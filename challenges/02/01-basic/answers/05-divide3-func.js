// Create a function, `divide3`, that takes three numbers as arguments. The function should return the first number divided by the second number divided by the third number.

let divide3 = function (a, b, c) {
    return a / b / c;
};

console.log(divide3(8, 2, 2)); // 2
console.log(divide3(100, 20, 5)); // 1
