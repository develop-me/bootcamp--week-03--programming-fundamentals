# Strings & Numbers

For each challenge create a new `.js` file. Then run `node filename.js` to see if it's worked.

Copy the code for each challenge into your file and fill out the `// your code here` part:

1) Add up the numbers:

    ```javascript
    let number1 = 10,
        number2 = 20,
        number3 = 30,
        number4 = 40;

    let sum = // your code here
    console.log(sum); // 100
    ```

1) Without changing the variable values, join the strings together with a space in between (create a separate file for each version):

    1. Using concatenation
    2. Using interpolation

    ```javascript
    let string1 = "I",
        string2 = "like",
        string3 = "to",
        string4 = "boogie",
        string5 = "boogie";

    let joined = // your code here
    console.log(joined); // "I like to boogie boogie"
    ```

1) Add up the numbers:

    ```javascript
    let number1 = 10,
        number2 = 20,
        dodgyNumber3 = "100",
        number4 = 40;

    let sum = // your code here
    console.log(sum); // 170
    ```

For the next exercises, remember to use `console.log()` to see your answer:

1) Work out what 1 quadrillion (a one with 15 zeroes after it) divided by 17, minus 8 is (it should start `588` and end in `56.7`)

1) Is 7 a factor of 864,197,523? (i.e. does it divide by 7 with no remainder)

## Tricksy

1) If you had a grid containing 100 items split into 12 columns, what column would the 77th item be in? You'll need to think about how to work this out!
