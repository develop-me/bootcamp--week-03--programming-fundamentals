## To Do

- Easier quiz
- More basic object challenges
    > Few more non-array challenges
- More basic array challenges
- Just use fat arrow functions?
- Notes about passing variables to functions
    > Make it clear that the name is not important
- Diagrams of concepts
    * [ ] Order of execution
    * [ ] Functions: parameters/arguments
    * [ ] Iterator Methods
    * [ ] Loops
- Flowcharts?
    * [ ] What type to use
    * [ ] Writing a function
- `console.log()` notes in Node section (Chapter 1)
- `String.prototype.trim()`
- `Math.random()`
- Some `switch` challenges
- Talk about using pseudo-code to work through questions - comments as you go
- Objects: Computed property names
- More test cases
    * [ ] Less [1, 2, 3, 4]
    * [ ] More negative numbers
- Rename array iterator functions so can reuse functions from Tuesday
    > Encourage reuse of existing functions
    * [ ] Update answers to use composition
- Move concatenation and issues with numbers strings to after variables?
- Some logic challenges?
- Number challenges
- console.assert() for basic testing?

## Doing


## Done

- Some notes about programming practice: CodeWars, Exercism, Eloquent JavaScript, etc.
- Split into more chapters
- Bit more about using Node
- Something about reading Node errors
- Methods often don't take arguments
- Talk about pure functions
- Talk about default initial value for reducers
    > Look into whether it skips first iteration if default not supplied
    * [x] Initial vs default initial value
- Add more information about array iterator methods using a function
- Add example of accessing nested object `blah.thing.stuff`
- Remove references to Mark
- Add infobox about using map, filter, and reduce with arrays of objects
- Talk about object instances and object literals
- Glossary
- Add more about nested array/object spread copying to notes
- Rename challenge files to 'README.md'
- `=>` in objects doesn't have access to `this`
- Fewer `for` loop challenges in the quiz
- `Array.prototype.splice` - for removing elements from an array
- Include `[].reverse()` somewhere
- Move array max challenge further down
- Use IIFEs for earlier challenges
    > Establish that you can pass variables to functions earlier on
- Move map, filter, reduce with object arrays to Day 4 morning
