## Functions

- In **VS Code**
- A function is a block of code that does a specific thing
- We can use it as many times as we like
- Show anonymous addition function first
- Can assign a function to a variable like any other value
- Functions don't run until you **call** them
- When you call a function you can pass it **arguments**
- Functions normally return values
- **Fat arrow** syntax
    - one line
    - multi-line with `return`
    - not *identical* to normal function, but advanced topic
- Example: multiple three numbers
- You should declare your functions before you use them, they won't run until **call** them (`order.js`)
- You can put as much as you like inside a function: `greet.js`
- Writing functions:
    1. Think of a sensible name for the function: a short way of describing its purpose
    2. Think about how many arguments the function needs to accept: this will depend on what you're trying to do
    3. Think about what type of thing the function should return
    4. Write out the boilerplate
    5. The thinky bit: Work about how to turn the arguments into the return value
    6. Test it with a few values you know the answer to
    7. Optional: Refactor
- Example **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: `let celsius = fahrenheit => (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8;` - make sure to test it
